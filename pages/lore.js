      <h1>THE BEGINNING OF THE END</h1>
      <p>In the time before memory, Arceus stood as the architect of all creation, the Original One who shaped reality itself.</p>
      <p>But perfection breeds contempt, and in the infinite expanse of his power, he grew to despise what it had built.</p>
      <p class="emphasis-text">The world was too complete, too ordered, too stable.</p>
      <p class="italic-text">Where was the artistry in eternal completion? Where was the thrill of watching intricate designs collapse into entropy?</p>
      <p>And so, the Original One began to plot the unmaking of everything he had created.</p>
      <p>He did not destroy the world outright; that would be too simple, too merciful. Instead, he reached into the deepest foundations of reality, the <strong>Void Between Worlds</strong>, and tore open a wound.</p>
      <p>Through this breach, he summoned entities that should never have existed: <strong>The Administrator, The Broken End</strong>, and most terrible of all, <strong>Giratina turned Integrity, the Herald of Unmaking.</strong></p>

      <h1>5 YEARS AGO</h1>
      <p>Two exploration teams rose to prominence in the region now known as the Shattered Territories. They were young, barely sixteen, but already skilled beyond their years.</p>
      
      <div class="team-block">
        <h3>Team Blackout</h3>
        <p>Blackout (Tyranitar) – Leader</p>
        <p>Rye (Luxray)</p>
        <p>Kyria (Liepard)</p>
      </div>

      <div class="team-block">
        <h3>Team Voidseeker</h3>
        <p>Null (Zoroark) – Leader</p>
        <p>Sekani (Registeel)</p>
        <p>Whyer (Absol)</p>
      </div>

      <p>During an expedition, Null discovered something impossible: <strong>Void Echoes</strong>, crystalline structures that emitted sounds that shouldn't exist. They warped space, <strong>made Pokémon vanish when they drew too close</strong>, and felt wrong in ways no one could explain.</p>
      <p class="emphasis-text">They were fragments of the Void itself, leaking into reality.</p>
      
      <p>One day, Null was ambushed by The Broken End. His consciousness was shattered into countless fragments.</p>
      <p>The primary shard became <strong>Null</strong>, a ghostly presence still trying to warn others. Other fragments became twisted echoes, like <strong>Nihil</strong>, a mimic that wears Null's face but serves Integrity.</p>
      
      <p>Sekani found a <strong>Soothe Bell</strong> that wouldn't stop ringing. The sound was wrong, vibrating in frequencies that bent reality. Over time, his steel body warped into something unnatural. He became <strong>Curved</strong>, an aggressive entity still haunted by fragments of Sekani's original mind.</p>
      
      <p>Blackout ventured deep into a cave one day and never returned. His teammates found only traces: scorch marks that spiraled in impossible directions, claw marks that seemed to fold through rocky walls and terrain.</p>
      
      <p>Kyria experienced the <strong>Moon Glitch</strong>, a phenomenon where Arceus's corruption manifested physically in the world. One night, the moon itself seemed to crack and bleed void-energy across the sky.</p>
      <p class="italic-text">That same night, Integrity materialized in Kyria's home; she tried to run and to fight…But you cannot fight the fundamental breakdown of existence.</p>
      
      <p>Records become unclear here. Some survivors claim they saw Kyria flee the region. Others say she became something else entirely.</p>

    <section class="lore-content-section">
      <h1>NOWADAYS</h1>
      <p>Five years later, the Void Echoes have multiplied and Integrity continues his patient work of unmaking.</p>
      
      <div class="warning-box">
        <h2>WARNING TO ALL EXPLORATION TEAMS</h2>
        <p class="italic-text">The Shattered Territories are not a challenge to overcome, they are a tomb that's still filling.</p>
        <p>If you see structures made of impossible materials, <strong class="danger">RUN</strong>.</p>
        <p>If you hear sounds that don't belong, <strong class="danger">HIDE</strong>.</p>
        <p>If you meet someone who seems wrong, <strong class="danger">DON'T TRUST THEM.</strong></p>
        <p>And if you ever, <strong><em>EVER</em></strong> see the moon begin to crack…</p>
        <p><strong>Leave this region and never return.</strong></p>
        <p class="italic-text">Because Arceus is always watching. And he's so very bored of what he built.</p>
