      <h1>THE BEGINNING OF THE END</h1>
      <p>In the time before memory, Arceus stood as the architect of all creation, the Original One who shaped reality itself. But perfection breeds contempt, and in the infinite expanse of his power, he grew to despise what it had built. <span class="emphasis-text">The world was too complete, too ordered, too stable.</span></p>
      
      <p><span class="italic-text">Where was the artistry in eternal completion? Where was the thrill of watching intricate designs collapse into entropy?</span></p>
      
      <p>And so, the Original One began to plot the unmaking of everything he had created. He did not destroy the world outright, that would be too simple, too merciful. Instead, he reached into the deepest foundations of reality, the <strong>Void Between Worlds</strong>, and tore open a wound.</p>
      
      <p>From the Void, he pulled forth corrupted versions of his own creations: <strong>The Administrator</strong>, what remained of Palkia after the Void consumed it, <strong>The Broken End</strong>, Dialga twisted beyond recognition, and most terrible of all, <strong>Integrity</strong>, Giratina reborn as the Herald of Unmaking. These entities originated from the Void itself, no longer the guardians they once were, but instruments of reality's destruction. Under Arceus's influence, Integrity became a living manifestation of corruption that spread like a disease through reality itself. </p> 
       <p><span class="italic-text">Where Integrity walked, the world broke, physics failed, memories shattered and souls splintered.</span></p>

      <h1>5 YEARS AGO</h1>
      <p>Two exploration teams rose to prominence in what is now known as the Shattered Territories. They were young, barely sixteen, but already skilled beyond their years.</p>
      
      <div class="team-block">
        <h3>Team Blackout</h3>
        <p>Blackout (Tyranitar) – Leader</p>
        <p>Rye (Luxray)</p>
        <p>Kyria (Liepard)</p>
      </div>

      <div class="team-block">
        <h3>Team Voidseeker</h3>
        <p>Null (Zoroark) – Leader</p>
        <p>Sekani (Registeel)</p>
        <p>Whyer (Absol)</p>
      </div>

      <p>During an expedition, Null discovered something impossible: <strong>Void Echoes</strong>, crystalline structures that emitted sounds that shouldn't exist. They warped space, <strong>made Pokémon vanish when they drew too close</strong>, and felt wrong in ways no one could explain. <span class="emphasis-text">They were fragments of the Void itself, leaking into reality.</span></p>
      
      <p>One day, Null was ambushed by The Broken End. Across 126 different timelines, The Broken End hunted and killed him, each death fracturing his consciousness further. The primary shard became <strong>Null</strong>, a ghostly presence still trying to warn others. But the other 126 fragments became <strong>Nihil</strong>, twisted echoes that wear Null's face and serve the Void and Integrity directly.</p>
      
      <p>Sekani found a <strong>Soothe Bell</strong> that wouldn't stop ringing. The sound was wrong, vibrating in frequencies that bent reality. Over time, his body warped into something unnatural. He became <strong>Curved</strong>, an aggressive entity that appears in tunnels and caves. Those who encounter him never come back.</p>
      
      <p>Blackout ventured deep into a cave one day and never returned. His teammates found only traces: scorch marks that spiraled in impossible directions, claw marks that seemed to fold through rocky walls and terrain.</p>
      
      <p>Kyria experienced the <strong>Moon Glitch</strong>, a phenomenon where Arceus's corruption manifested physically in the world. One night, the moon itself seemed to crack and bleed void-energy across the sky. <span class="italic-text">That same night, Integrity materialized in Kyria's home; she tried to run and to fight…But you cannot fight the fundamental breakdown of existence.</span> Records become unclear here. Some survivors claim they saw Kyria flee the region. Others say she became something else entirely.</p>
