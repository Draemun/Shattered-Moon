      <p>The Alone does not speak, does not negotiate and does not pause to let you process what is happening to you. The entirety of its purpose and the entirety of its behavior under normal circumstances is hunt. It selects targets and kills. There is no pattern a survivor has lived to reliably report.</p>
      <p>Its appendages are capable of mimicking the appearance of ordinary Pokémon. Witnesses who survived peripheral encounters describe seeing something that looked almost right, almost familiar, before the shape collapsed into what it actually was. The mimicry is not perfect up close, but The Alone only needs it to work long enough to close the distance. It works best in low light, in fog and in the deep cave systems where it has been most frequently reported.</p>
      <p>It also operates through sensory deprivation. The cavern disturbances reported prior to the Veldenroot incident are consistent with its known behavioral pattern: low, unlocatable growling that travels through stone corridors without a traceable origin point, the persistent sensation of being watched from directions that reveal nothing when investigated, and most critically, a pull. Witnesses describe it as a feeling rather than a sound or a sight, a sensation of being wanted somewhere, of something in the dark requiring their presence.</p>
      <p>Several civilians followed this pull into the Veldenroot cave systems. None were recovered.</p>

      <p><span class="emphasis-text">Confirmed Moves:</span> Sacred Fire, Eruption, Flare Blitz, Scorching Sands, and Burning Bulwark. The heat it produces is immediate and physically overwhelming, described by survivors as stealing breath from the lungs on first contact. Scene pictures report stone blackened and mineral veins in cavern walls glowing from proximity alone.</p>
      <p>Physical resilience is extreme. The full combined assault of four Echelon-ranked combatants produced no meaningful damage under normal engagement. The only environmental factor observed to cause any suppression of its capabilities was Misty Terrain, which visibly recoiled its fire and produced what witnesses interpreted as irritation. Weapon-imbued attacks produced the only observable physical reactions. Direct elemental strikes produced nothing of consequence.</p>
      <p>It grew eyes. When one was destroyed during the Veldenroot incident, the socket swelled, ruptured, and produced multiple replacements within seconds, spreading across its neck, shoulders, and hide, each one functional and tracking independently. This appears to be an accelerated regenerative response specific to sensory organs. Whether this extends to full tissue regeneration under standard conditions or was specific to the anomalous circumstances of the Veldenroot encounter is not yet confirmed.</p>
      <hr style="border: none; border-top: 1px solid var(--border-color); margin: 30px 0;">
      <p class="emphasis-text">The Alone does not normally behave the way it did in Veldenroot.</p>
      <p>This requires emphasis, because the Veldenroot incident has produced the most detailed firsthand account of The Alone that Chronicler records contain, and it would be dangerous to treat that account as representative of standard engagement.</p>
      <p>The Alone does not speak, nor does not play games or deliver countdowns or let combatants escape because it found the chase entertaining. It hunts, kills, and moves on. The behavior documented in Veldenroot, the mimicry of a specific individual, the psychological targeting, the deliberate theatrical cruelty, the speech, is not The Alone. Or rather, it is not only The Alone.</p>
      <p>Cross-referencing the Echelon field report with available anomalous entity records, Chroniclers have reached a conclusion that has been difficult to commit to documentation: The Alone in Veldenroot was being used. What possessed The Alone during the Veldenroot incident has been tentatively attributed to Arceus.</p>
      <p>Chroniclers acknowledge this sounds extraordinary. It is being documented anyway, because the alternative is leaving the Echelons without accurate information about what they actually encountered, and that is a far worse outcome than an entry that strains credibility.</p>
      <p><span class="emphasis-text">What this means in practical terms:</span> The Alone, under standard conditions, is a silent apex predator that kills without ceremony. If you encounter something wearing The Alone's form that speaks to you, knows things about you, and seems to be enjoying itself, you are not dealing with The Alone alone. The situation is worse than the entity log prepared you for. Act accordingly.</p>
      <p>Behavioral baseline for standard encounters: no communication, no hesitation, no pattern that has survived long enough to be documented reliably. The pull is the only consistent early warning. If you feel drawn toward a dark space without understanding why, treat it as a confirmed sighting and evacuate immediately.</p>
      <p class="emphasis-text">Do not investigate. Do not send someone else to investigate. Do not assume it is something else.</p>
      <p>The civilians who followed the pull into the Veldenroot caves have not been recovered. Chroniclers do not expect them to be.</p>
      <p>There is no current documented method for successfully fighting The Alone and winning. The Veldenroot team survived because they ran and because something decided to let them. Neither of those conditions can be planned for.</p>
      <p class="emphasis-text">Do not go into the dark if the dark is asking you to.</p>
