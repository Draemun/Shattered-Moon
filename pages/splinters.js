      <h1>SOUL SPLINTERS</h1>
      <p>When the Void's Corruption hits a Pokémon, it fractures their soul and these fragments become Soul Splinters, manifestations of twisted consciousness that often (but not always) serve Arceus's will. The resulting corruption manifests in different forms depending on the strength of the corrupting force and how much of the victim's consciousness survives the splintering process.</p>
      
      <p class="emphasis-text">Soul Splinters are contagious.</p>
      
      <p>When a Pokémon is struck by a Soul Splinter's attack, reality around them begins to fracture, as each hit weakens the barrier between their consciousness and the Void.</p>
      
      <p>In every case, the victim begins to experience:</p>
      <ul class="rules-list">
        <li>Visual Distortions</li>
        <li>Temporal Displacement - Time becomes unstable. Seconds stretch into hours. Hours compress into moments.</li>
        <li>Memory Corruption - They forget names and faces. Their own identity begins to dissolve.</li>
        <li>Physical Degradation - Their body begins to break down.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>This is called the Call of the Void, and once it takes hold, there are only three outcomes:</p>
      
      <p><strong>1. Salvation</strong> - Another Pokémon intervenes with Nexus Cores (the rarest outcome), or by forcing the victim away from the source.</p>
      
      <p><strong>2. Corruption</strong> - The victim's soul splinters, and they become another entity serving Arceus's design. You become a Lesser Soul if any splinter turns you. However, if a legendary turns you, you may become an Echo variant instead, depending on how much of your consciousness survives the splintering.</p>
      
      <p><strong>3. The Endless Moment</strong> - The victim's consciousness becomes trapped in a liminal space accessed through Ultra Wormholes, neither alive nor dead, neither broken nor whole. They exist in eternal, frozen agony, aware but unable to act, scattered across infinite versions of a moment that never ends. Echoes sometimes venture into this dimension, where they become tangible and can offer what little help they can to those trapped in The Endless Moment, as well as better communicating with those in the Shattered territories. Tragically, it's never enough for something concrete. They do not have access to settlements.</p>

      <h1>COMBAT AGAINST SOUL SPLINTERS</h1>
      <p>Soul Splinters exist partially outside physical reality, making conventional combat almost completely useless, as they're completely immune to Pokémon moves. Your Pokémon can still use their powers, but doing so near an anomaly is extremely dangerous. Energy discharge can attract hostile entities, destabilize reality in favour of splinters, or trigger aggressive responses from otherwise passive splinters.</p>
      
      <h3>TL;DR</h3>
      <ul class="rules-list">
        <li>Attacks deal minimal damage</li>
        <li>Weapons are effective - It was discovered that forged items can interact with corrupted matter</li>
        <li>Weapons + Moves combined is the most effective combat method</li>
        <li>Terrain Moves, Weather Changing Moves and Traps can damage them</li>
        <li>Abilities do not work on Soul Splinters</li>
        <li>Status moves are largely ineffective - Sleep, paralysis, poison mean nothing to fractured souls</li>
      </ul>

            <p>A Husk is what remains when a soul completely loses coherence during the splintering process. Nothing of the original consciousness survives: no memories, no will, no sense of self. They are empty vessels animated by corrupted energy.</p>
            <p>The Ashes is a standard result of falling to the Call of the Void. Their consciousness scattered completely, leaving only an empty, hostile shell. The soul broke down so thoroughly that nothing of the original being remains.</p>
            <ul class="rules-list">
              <li>They hunt exclusively at night, avoiding daylight. Light/Brightness makes them flee</li>

            <p>An Echo is a pokemon who splintered but managed to hold onto fragments of their original consciousness. They exist in a liminal state, corrupted but not entirely lost. Unlike Ashes, NIRs retain pieces of who they were. They remember things, distorted and incomplete, but real. They can think, choose, and even communicate.</p>
            <p>NIRs exhibit highly variable behavior:</p>
            <ul class="rules-list">
              <li>Some are jealous and resentful of the uncorrupted, attacking out of spite for what they've lost</li>
              <li>Some embrace their corruption and serve Arceus willingly, spreading corruption to please their master</li>
              <li>Some resist the corruption, using their position to guide lost travelers and shield others from splintering</li>
              <li>Some simply observe, waiting for something they've forgotten, trapped between worlds</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The NIRs trapped in the Endless Moment are whole within that dimension. Their consciousness exists fully in the frozen moment, but can only partially project into physical reality.</p>

      <h3>Splintering method:</h3>
      <ul class="rules-list">
        <li>5 attacks from legendary splinter</li>
        <li>Death by legendary splinter (you're stuck in the Endless Moment)</li>

          <td>The Silhouette</td>
          <td>Echo</td>
          <td>
            <p>The Silhouette is the result of legendary corruption forcing consciousness through a traumatic crystallization process. The victim's soul is trapped in a warped crystalline prison of their own body. Despite the severe physical transformation, the core consciousness remains, twisted, trapped, and in perpetual agony, but aware. The victim knows what they've become. They recognize others. They understand their own horror.</p>
            <p>Physical Manifestation:</p>
            <ul class="rules-list">
              <li>Deformed crystalline version of their original form</li>
              <li>Body shakes erratically, as the physical manifestation of the consciousness is struggling within</li>
              <li>They tend to attack on sight with extreme aggression</li>
              <li>Safe observation is nearly impossible: their crystalline form refracts reality itself</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Unique Trait: Silhouettes can summon Sub-Anomaly 1 (for 3 turns, 3 turns cooldown), the cloud of black spastic particles representing complete breakdown at the particle level. Their bodies exist at the threshold between matter and dissolution, giving them influence over the space where form itself collapses. Silhouettes can call forth these particle clouds and direct them toward other anomalies or splintered pokemon. The particles damage anything they touch, making Silhouettes paradoxically useful in corrupted zones if one can somehow influence their targeting, though this is extraordinarily dangerous given their hostile nature.</p>

            <p>Unique Trait: This pair cannot be copied by any other entity. Zoroark illusions or Dittos attempting to mimic them drop immediately. Weaver illusions hold until they attack, as the act of violence disrupts their mimicry.</p>

            <p>Faraways are the intangible remnants of corrupted Cresselias, trapped in the Endless Moment, but able to manifest on Miralen. They are consciousness without form, aware but without the ability to interact directly with physical reality. They remember their purpose as protectors of dreams. They choose to guide and assist those who got lost or are on the verge of corruption.</p>
            <ul class="rules-list">
              <li>They appear near sleeping Pokémon or those on the verge of corruption</li>
              <li>If unobserved, they can move. Direct eye contact makes them freeze</li>
              <li>They cannot attack unless a Thorn Weaver is present. Then they're vicious, warding off nightmares and shielding dreamers</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Some believe they are splinters of something that once knew how to help, desperately trying to remember what that felt like. They are hope persisting even in corruption, consciousness clinging to purpose despite losing the means to fulfill it.</p>

            <p>Thorn Weavers are specialized variants of Weaver entities created from corrupted Darkrai. They inherit and corrupt Darkrai's ability to manipulate dreams and nightmares. They retain full consciousness and possess sophisticated cognitive abilities. They understand psychology, plan complex attacks, and can manipulate the boundary between dreams and reality.</p>
            <p>The most dangerous trait of Thorn Weavers is their ability to breach the barrier between dreams and waking reality. They can manifest physically from within a victim's subconscious, making them virtually impossible to defend against.</p>
            <p>The most common symptoms of a Thorn Weaver attack are:</p>
            <ul class="rules-list">
              <li>Psychological destabilization</li>
              <li>Induced hallucinations</li>
              <li>Direct physical harm manifesting from dreams</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Thorn Weavers are classified as high-threat entities. Encounters frequently result in death. Their relationship with Faraways is particularly interesting. The presence of a Thorn Weaver causes Faraways to become protective rather than passive, suggesting some remnant of the original Cresselia-Darkrai opposition persists even in corruption.</p>

      <h1>SPECIAL TERRAIN CONDITION: SUB-ANOMALY 1</h1>
      <p>Sub-Anomaly 1 is the ultimate failure of coherence: a cloud of black, spastic particles without any discernible body or consciousness. It is what remains when a soul can no longer hold even a basic form. Sub-Anomaly 1 exists below the threshold of both classifications. Husks are empty but maintain physical form and basic behavioral patterns. Echoes retain fragments of consciousness. Sub-Anomaly 1 possesses neither. It is pure breakdown at the particle level, corruption so complete that individual existence has dissolved entirely.</p>
