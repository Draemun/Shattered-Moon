      <h1>NEXUS CORES</h1>
      <p>Nexus Cores are the product of Void Echoes charged with specific moves. The expertise and power required means that usually only the Guild can access those resources. Most individual Pokémon simply cannot access those resources due to the risks (despite Void Echoes being findable by anyone).</p>
      
      <h3>Obtaining Void Echoes</h3>
      <p>Void Echoes can be found by exploring caves, deep where Legendary Splinters usually rest. Roll a d20. 17-20 means you've discovered one Void Echo. They can be obtained through Staff RP or by completing S+ rank missions.</p>
      
      <h3>Creating a Nexus Core</h3>
      <p>Once enough Void Echoes are gathered, they're formed into a Nexus Core. This crystal must then be charged with one of the specific lunar moves:</p>
      <ul class="rules-list">
        <li>Blood Moon</li>
        <li>Lunar Blessing</li>
        <li>Lunar Dance</li>
        <li>Moonblast, Moonlight</li>
        <li>Splintered Stormshard (Night-form Lycanroc only)</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="emphasis-text">This method leaves ANY mutation the splintering brought, but removes the various eyes.</p>

      <h1>CORRUPTION REVERSAL</h1>
      <p>When a Legendary Pokémon directly unsplinters someone, the result is perfect. The Pokémon is completely reset with no mutations, no complications and no lingering damage. However, each Legendary can only do this once in their entire existence (5,000 BTS reward.) Once a Legendary has used their one unsplinter, they can never do it again for anyone else (unless allowed in special circumstances.)</p>
      
      <p class="emphasis-text">This scarcity means Legendary intervention is reserved only for the most critical or deserving cases.</p>

      <h1>MEMORY RECOLLECTION</h1>
      <p>Recalling memories is the defining mechanic for reversing splintering's effects because it reconnects a Pokémon with their former life from the inside out, allowing them to break away from splintering through rediscovering who they truly are. The more memories a Pokémon collects, the more they can act as their former self. But here's the critical distinction: simply gaining clarity and awareness that you're splintered isn't enough. A Pokémon must actively recall specific memories, actually re-experiencing and integrating them back into their conscious identity. This Recalling process comes with a price that varies depending on the type of memory being recovered.</p>
      
      <p>Memories cannot be perceived by most Pokémon. They're hidden, fragmented, inaccessible through normal means; this makes collecting them incredibly difficult. Many Pokémon have tried to forcibly make others remember themselves through various techniques, but almost all have failed. Only one group has ever achieved consistent success in helping Pokémon trace their memories back to their source.</p>

      <h3>Core Memories</h3>
      <p>Core memories are the big, defining moments in a Pokémon's life that create the very foundation of who they are. Every formative experience can be classed as a core memory, the moment they evolved, the loss of someone precious, a life-changing decision, a triumph, a failure that shaped them forever. Most Pokémon have at least 5 core memories, though this number varies from individual to individual. Older Pokémon are more likely to have several core memories simply because they've lived longer and accumulated more defining moments. Pokémon who have been through intense experiences, such as trauma, adventure, hardship, will have more core memories on average regardless of their age. A young Pokémon who survived something horrific might have as many core memories as an elderly Pokémon who lived peacefully.</p>
      
      <p>It's crucial to understand that there is no connection between core memories and strength or power level. Even Husks still have at least one core memory buried somewhere inside them. When a core memory is recalled, the experience is overwhelming. Everything clicks into place at once in a rush of recognition so intense it's physically debilitating. The Pokémon suffers a stun so severe they're left confused and vulnerable for 5 turns, unable to defend themselves or think clearly, so they might attack foes in a frenzy. After all, it's the moment when a massive piece of their identity slots back into place, and the shock of reunion, even as it's liberating, can be traumatic.</p>

      <h3>Ambient Memories</h3>
      <p>Ambient memories are the far more common cousin of core memories. They're the bulk of a Pokémon's day-to-day, short-term experiences (the taste of a favorite berry, the warmth of sunlight, a casual conversation, the sound of rain on leaves…) While ambient memories don't offer the same mind-shattering effect that clicks everything together like core memories do, they can chain toward core memories without the Pokémon being traumatically ripped open.</p>
      
      <p>Here's an example of a chain:</p>
      <ul class="rules-list">
        <li>A Pokémon sees a red bandanna</li>
        <li>They remember they like the color red</li>
        <li>They remember being made something like it</li>
        <li>They remember someone made it for them</li>
        <li>They remember their mother</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>Each step builds naturally on the last, creating a pathway back to a core memory, without the devastating shock of having it all hit at once. A typical chain consists of about 5-10 ambient memories leading toward one core memory. No more than 2 ambient memories can be gained per RP session. This prevents destabilizing rapid recovery and ensures the process remains gradual. The reality is that chaining memories takes time that not all Pokémon can afford and ambient memories alone aren't enough to fully pull away from splintering.</p>

      <h3>Memory Discovery Mechanics</h3>
      <p>For the most part, memory discovery is governed by chance. Pokémon don't knowingly stumble upon their memories, the process is unpredictable and often surprising.</p>
      
      <p><span class="emphasis-text">For Core Memories:</span> After completing any RP session, a player can roll a d20 to see if their character experienced a core memory recall during that session. On a roll of 17 - 20, the character immediately recalls a core memory, regardless of what actually happened in the RP's narrative. This is one of those unexpected moments when something suddenly unlocks something deep. If the roll fails, the player simply tries again after their next RP.</p>
      
      <p><span class="emphasis-text">For Ambient Memories:</span> Chaining is much easier and more accessible than core memory rolls. However, all ambient memory gains must be recorded in character updates after every success.</p>

      <h3>Submission Mechanic</h3>
      <p>Players have flexibility in how they document their character's core memories, but please, include them directly in the character's profile document. Specifics aren't necessary unless the player wants to provide them. What matters is tracking the amount of core memories a character has, so everyone knows their progress toward full recovery.</p>

      <h3>Aura Guardians</h3>
      <p>The only Pokémon species that has ever successfully traced full memories to their source are from the Lucario line. Their aura-reading abilities allow them to perceive the threads and fragments of memory within other Pokémon and help guide them back to the origin points. Legendary Pokémon can also trace memories to their sources, though their perception is less clear and precise than a Lucario's. They sense memories more vaguely, without the fine detail and emotional resonance that Aura Guardians can perceive. Still, their raw power often compensates for this lack of clarity.</p>

      <h3>Static/Fog</h3>
      <p>When attempting to collect or Recall a memory, Pokémon encounter something Static or Fog, a resistance that makes the process difficult and draining. It's an interference that prevents memories from surfacing clearly, the mental and emotional barrier that splintering creates to protect itself. Pushing it too hard might turn a Splintered Pokémon hostile and make them attack.</p>
