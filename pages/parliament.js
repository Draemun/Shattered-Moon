      <h1>THE PARLIAMENT</h1>
      <p>Last Haven is the largest and final organized settlement to endure after the fall of the old world. To give every survivor a place suited to their typing, the land was divided into 5 main districts, adapted to the group's needs. At its heart sits the Parliament, an assembly of guardians voted to speak for and protect the needs of the type they represent.</p>
      
      <p>The leader is a Silvally, chosen because they can shift between all 18 types. They act as the tie-breaker and emergency authority. They override Guild decisions only in extreme cases, and even then, they have to act accordingly to majority vote.</p>
      
      <p>Each representative represents a district, a habitat zone where Pokémon of that type thrive.</p>

      <h3>Representative Duties</h3>
      <ul class="rules-list">
        <li>Speak for the needs, struggles, and concerns of their typing</li>
        <li>Mediate disputes within their district</li>
        <li>Protect their district with their life if needed</li>
        <li>Maintain communication with the Guild</li>
        <li>Vote on major decisions affecting Last Haven</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p class="emphasis-text">They are not rulers.</p>
      
      <p>They need a Noteworthy slot and high activity. They start at base BST and have immediate access to Egg and Amulet.</p>

      <h1>GUILD RELATIONSHIP</h1>
      <p>The Guild is the heart of operations in Last Haven; the Parliament won't override its decisions unless:</p>
      <ul class="rules-list">
        <li>A majority vote is reached</li>
        <li>The decision threatens the safety or rights of a district</li>
        <li>The Leader invokes emergency authority (rare)</li>
      </ul>

      <h1>THE TRIBUNAL OF TYPES</h1>
      <p>When an Outlaw is captured, they are brought before the entire Parliament. There's three most possible outcomes:</p>
      
      <h3>Repayment</h3>
      <p>For crimes that harmed individuals or small communities. This includes labor, service, restitution and community rebuilding.</p>
      
      <h3>Seclusion</h3>
      <p>For dangerous but redeemable individuals. They're confined to a monitored settlement or a cell, limited in their movements in lighter cases, rehabilitated under Guild supervision.</p>
      
      <h3>Banishment</h3>
      <p>For those who cannot be trusted within Haven. They risk being banned from all settlements and the guild is authorized to detain on sight. This is the harshest punishment, essentially a social and proper death sentence.</p>
