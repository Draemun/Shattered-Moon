      <p>These roles represent high-impact positions within the Shattered Territories. Holding one means:</p>
      <ul class="rules-list">
        <li><strong>Responsibility:</strong> You'll work closely with staff and help shape server dynamics.</li>
        <li><strong>Lore Confidence:</strong> You must be familiar with the setting and its mechanics.</li>
        <li><strong>Activity:</strong> Regular engagement is expected. If you disappear for months or don't respond to staff for extended periods, the role may be reassigned. Please DM Modmail if you're planning a long hiatus.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Noteworthy Characters are local celebrities (famous, infamous, or otherwise known). This role is unlimited, as long as you hold a slot, and reflects your character's popularity or notoriety in the story.</p>

      <p>Echelons are the strongest warriors of each faction, chosen for their exceptional prowess and loyalty. There is one Echelon per faction and each serves directly beneath their respective Commander.</p>
      <p>They start at 800 BST (rewards included). Echelons are considered an elite class, and their stats threshold will be higher than those of non-Noteworthy characters.</p>
      <p>They are expected to embody the values and strengths of their faction in both combat and narrative.</p>

      <p>With 30 endorsements and 3,000 BTS (Guild Senior) the character is promoted to a Praetor. Praetors are the elite cadre directly beneath an Echelon.</p>
      <p>While Echelons are the singular champions of their faction, Praetors form the pool of potential successors who have proven themselves worthy of standing one step below the pinnacle.</p>
      <p>Archons mirror the rank and standing of Praetors, but exist outside the guild structure (Outlaw (with reports instead of endorsements)/Independent/Splinters).</p>
      <p>They all receive the full suite of Goal 7 rewards, though their promotion does not grant any stat increase. They have a chance to be invited to more exclusive missions.</p>

      </table>
      <p>Higher Souls share the same stat threshold as Echelons and Commanders, but their origin is different.</p>
      <p>These characters have been Soul Splintered by legendary entities, meaning their essence has been fractured and reshaped by direct contact with a legendary force.</p>
      <p>Because of this, Soul Splintering must be included in the character's backstory.</p>

      <p>Representatives start at base BST and immediately get Egg + Amulet.</p>
      <p>At 30 endorsements the character becomes automatically a Noteworthy.</p>
